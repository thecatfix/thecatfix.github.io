# Safe Sender List In Outlook

## To add a sender to the safe senders list in Outlook for Office 365, you can follow these steps:

## Using Outlook on the Web

1. Open Outlook on the Web: Go to [Outlook on the Web](https://outlook.office.com) and sign in with your Office 365 credentials.
2. Go to Settings: Click on the gear icon (⚙️) in the upper-right corner to open the Settings menu.
3. View All Outlook Settings: At the bottom of the Settings pane, click on "View all Outlook settings."
4. Mail Settings: In the Settings window, navigate to Mail > Junk email.
5. Safe Senders and Domains: Under "Safe senders and domains," click the + Add button.
6. Add a Safe Sender: Type the email address or domain you want to add to the safe senders list and press Enter.
7. Save Changes: Click Save at the bottom of the settings window.

## Using Outlook Desktop App

1. Open Outlook: Launch the Outlook desktop app.
2. Go to Junk Email Options: Click on the Home tab, then select Junk > Junk E-mail Options....
3. Safe Senders: In the Junk E-mail Options window, go to the Safe Senders tab.
4. Add to Safe Senders: Click the Add... button, then type the email address or domain you want to add and click OK.
5. Apply and Close: Click Apply and then OK to save the changes and close the Junk E-mail Options window.

By adding an email address or domain to your safe senders list, you ensure that emails from these senders will not be moved to your Junk Email folder.

**Notes**

- Domains: If you add a domain (e.g., example.com), all emails from any address ending in @example.com will be considered safe.
- Sync: Changes made in Outlook on the Web will sync with the Outlook desktop app and vice versa, provided you're using the same Office 365 account.
