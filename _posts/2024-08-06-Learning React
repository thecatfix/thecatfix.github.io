# Learning React
Currently in week 2 of React and it is eye opening how it was developed.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. It is a component-based library which is used to develop interactive UI's (User Interfaces). I found a great documentation and I am excited to learn more about it on Youtube.
