# Why Is The Contact Application So Confusing

## Goal - Figure out how to create a class that would easily interchange with Apple Device, Google Device and Microsoft Device and have the following properties:

- Unique Identifier:
- Full Name:
- First Name:
- Last Name:
- Phone:
  - Is it home? work? other? mobile? cell?
- Email:
  - Same goes here: home? work? other?


## Exchanging the properties across multiple operating systems

I have no idea how to do this and I will have to be looking at either API schemas or SDKs
